\section{Deep Web Navigation Capabilities}
As described in the previous chapter, before Web 2.0, it was enough for the extraction systems to follow the links to embark on a required page to scrape data.
With the Web 2.0, a new interactive has widespread - web forms, which consequently were used with AJAX. It's impossible to predict what other new control elements will appear. Serrano is embedded in the browser and therefore tied to constantly updated versions of rendered. This enables Serrano to be always up-to-date.

Also new features like credential management - http://w3c.github.io/webappsec-credential-management/ are available to the system immediately.
